I've been avoiding it for some time now. After over 8 hours* of video courses and a working development environment, I am ready to write my first impressions. What prompted this ramp-up of interest in Docker? I was working with a member of my devops team to get a new site setup with continuous integretation and deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB), when he said that they support deployments with Docker Containers with a [how to link](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_docker.html).

<small>*\* I didn't actually watch 8 hours of content thanks to 2x playback speed, and skipping Windows specific segments since I'm on a Mac.*</small>

## Overview

If you're not familiar with Docker, you can find out more on [their site](https://www.docker.com/what-docker). At work I have a [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) subscription, and I have watched three videos so far that have helped broaden my understanding:
* [Docker and Containers: The Big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/docker-containers-big-picture), by Nigel Poulton
* [Getting Started with Docker](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/docker-getting-started), by Nigel Poulton
* [Docker for Web Developers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/docker-web-development), by Dan Wahlin

## Configuration

I have two Docker containers for this project, one for an API and the other for static React content. 

### Dockerfile for API

{% highlight dockerfile %}
FROM node:6.10.0

ENV NODE_ENV=development
ENV PORT=10010

COPY . /var/www
WORKDIR /var/www

RUN npm install

EXPOSE $PORT

ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "run", "serv"]
{% endhighlight %}
<br />
Lets take this a few lines at a time.

{% highlight dockerfile %}
FROM node:6.10.0
{% endhighlight %}

This probably doesn't need much explanation. It will use the Node.js v6.10.0 image, first checking your local images for a copy, and if it's not there, pulling (i.e. downloading) it from the Docker Store. Why 6.10.0, and not something newer? This is the [latest LTS version currently supported](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts.platforms.html#concepts.platforms.nodejs) by my EB version.

{% highlight dockerfile %}
ENV NODE_ENV=development
ENV PORT=10010
{% endhighlight %}

You can set Node variables in the Dockerfile that will be accessible throughout your node app. My app will use these to determine what config file to use and to set the port.

{% highlight dockerfile %}
COPY . /var/www
WORKDIR /var/www
{% endhighlight %}

The first command, `COPY`, is copying the contents of my entire application into the directory `/var/www/`. Since I want to be able to run commands from this directory, I set the working directory, `WORKDIR`, to point to this location as well. It doesn't have to be `/var/www/`, it could have been anywhere really, but I chose to stick with the example from the video course I was watching.

{% highlight dockerfile %}
RUN npm install
{% endhighlight %}

This is the same as typing `npm install` in the console - it will install all the dependencies in my `package.json` file.

{% highlight dockerfile %}
EXPOSE $PORT
{% endhighlight %}

The Docker container will run on the `$PORT`, which we defined earlier in `ENV PORT=10010`, and matches the port the node app is running on.

{% highlight dockerfile %}
ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "run", "serv"]
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, the `ENTRYPOINT` is the command my app will run on after it starts up. In this case, `serv` is an npm script I have set up in my `package.json` file to start the server.

### Dockerfile for React

{% highlight dockerfile %}
FROM nginx
COPY build /usr/share/nginx/html
{% endhighlight %}
<br />
This is a lot simpler. We get the latest image of `nginx`, and then copy the files from the `build` directly into `/usr/share/nginx/html`, where they will be served up statically. Piece of cake.
